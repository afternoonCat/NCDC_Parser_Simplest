# NCDC_Parser_Simplest

   This simplest NCDC record parser is based on Federal 
 Climate Complex Data Documentation for Integrated Surface 
 Data (ISD) released on January 12, 2018.
 
   The purpose of this parser is to parse an ISD record and 
 get the control and mandatory data as strings. 
   All additional ISD data (if any) is currently returned 
 as a string due to a great number of the properties and 
 getters and setters to be additionally coded.
